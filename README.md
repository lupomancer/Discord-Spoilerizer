# Discord-Spoilerizer
a python script that adds a spoiler tag to every single character in a given string

you just need to summon it from the command prompt or terminal by going to the directory you downloaded it to and typing:
python spoilers.py

You will need to have python installed. If you do not already, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Have fun
